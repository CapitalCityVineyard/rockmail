      <p>Man Camp is about 4 weeks away and I'm excited to announce that we have the largest group ever - 40 guys! If you'd like details about Man Camp, visit their website here: http://www.hartlandcamp.com/programs/man-camp. Wondering what to expect or what to bring? This page has all the details for you.</p>

      <p>Reminder, final payments are due no later than February 21. I believe Tammy send out a payment reminder to you all, so you can make your payment through that link.</p>

      <p>Have questions as far as driving details or anything not covered on the Man Camp website? Feel free to contact Josh Helm at his email here: helm.joshua@yahoo.com</p>

      <p>Looking forward to seeing you guys!</p>
