      <h3>Hi \{{ Person.NickName }},</h3>

      <p>Recently you received a link to take a DiSC assessment on Rock. We’d appriciate it if you could complete it tomorrow.</p>

      <p>The DISC assessment can help explain a lot about how you relate to others, who you get along with, and who you have trouble understanding. Because different personalities can be like different languages.</p>

      <p>Despite all of our differences, the best communicators know that there’s a simple, profound secret to connecting with anyone:</p>

      <p><strong>Empathy</strong></p>

      <p>When you understand someone else’s personality and use their communication style rather than your own, it’s like speaking in their native language.</p>

      <p>But how do you know what language to speak? <strong>That’s where DISC comes in.</strong></p>

      <p>With Rock you’ll be able to send out DISC requests to key ministry leaders, volunteers, and even Sunday attendees. So you’ll be able to talk with <strong>anyone</strong> like you’ve known them for years. </p>

      <p>To get started just take a DISC assessment yourself. It takes just a few minutes, and will help us a ton. (Reply to this email if you need a new link)</p>

      <p>If you’ve already taken the assessment and want to learn more about how to use DISC to accelerate your ministry, check out this article.</p>
<br/>
      <p>Thanks,</p>
<br/>
